## About
This is one of my favorite projects I worked on because I was really interested on dashboards, so I decide to develop one dashboard with COVID-19 data. Because all this situation we are struggling with, there is a lot of free COVID-19 data. Therefore, I started working on this app. This app is only developed using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, bootstrap, and jQuery.

Another reason I wanted to develop this app was because I wanted to learn Bootstrap. The app uses data from different APIs, so we can find global data, a search tool to find data by country, some chart to visualize the global data and by country, a tip card to remember wash your hands, a interactive map with all the cases by country, and a table with the cases by state in the U.S.

I learned a lot while developing this app. I like the final product with the finish look. The only problem is that sometimes, the app get blocked by one of the APIs and the information is not shown.
